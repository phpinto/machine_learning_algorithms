# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation of popular Machine Learning algorithms in MATLAB and Python. The programs in this repository are not guaranteed to be the most efficient implementations of these algorithms and had exclusively educational purposes.

List of Algorithms:

- Expectation Maximization (EM)
- Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- K-Means
- K-Medoids
- Linear Regression
- Matrix Factorixation based Recommender
- PageRank
- Random Forest
